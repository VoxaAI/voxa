Voxa
====================
Voxa is a framework that provides a way to organize a conversational experience into a state machine. Even the most complex voice user interface (VUI) can be represented through the state machine and it provides the flexibility needed to both be rigid when needed in specific states and flexible to jump around states when needed. 

Why Voxa vs other frameworks
----------------------------
Voxa provides a more robust framework for building Alexa skills, Cortana skills, or Google Assistant Actions.  It provides a design pattern that wasnâ€™t found in other frameworks.   Critical to Voxa was providing a pluggable interface and supporting all of the latest platform features.  Voxa is written primarily in TypeScript but skills and actions can utilize it in either JavaScript or TypeScript.

Installation
-------------

Usage
------

const views = {
  LaunchIntent: { tell: 'Hello World!' },
}

// initialize the skill
const skill = new Voxa({ views })

// respond to a LaunchIntent
skill.onIntent('LaunchIntent', (event) => {
  return { reply: 'LaunchIntent' };
});

// lambda handler
exports.handler = function handler(event, context, callback) {
  return skill.execute(event, context)
    .then(result => callback(null, result))
    .catch(callback);
}

```
