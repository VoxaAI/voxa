A fsm (state machine) framework for Alexa apps using Node.js

Summary
-------
Voxa is an Alexa skill framework that provides a way to organize a skill into a state machine. Even the most complex voice user interface (VUI) can be represented through the state machine and it provides the flexibility needed to both be rigid when needed in specific states and flexible to jump around when allowing that also makes sense.  

Why Voxa vs other frameworks
----------------------------
Voxa provides a more robust framework for building Alexa skills.  It provides a design pattern that wasnâ€™t found in other frameworks.   Critical to Voxa was providing a pluggable interface and supporting all of the latest ASK features.
