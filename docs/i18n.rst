I18N
=====

Internationalization support is done using the `i18next <http://i18next.com/>`_ library, the same the Amazon Alexa Node SDK uses.


Configuring the skill for I18N
-------------------------------

To use it you need to configure your skill to use the ``I18NRenderer`` class instead of the default renderer class.

.. code-block:: javascript

  const Voxa = require('voxa');
  const skill = new Voxa({ Model, variables, views, RenderClass: Voxa.I18NRenderer });

The framework takes care of selecting the correct locale on every alexa event by looking at the ``alexaEvent.request.locale`` property.

Changes in your views
----------------------

The other change you will need is to define your views using the `i18next translate <http://i18next.com/translate/>`_ format:

.. literalinclude:: ../test/i18n/views.js

Variables
----------

Variables should work mostly the same as with the ``DefaultRenderer``, with the exception that variables will now get a ``locale`` key

.. literalinclude:: ../test/variables.js
